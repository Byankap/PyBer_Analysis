# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Perform exploratory analysis to identify trends between different types of cities (urban, suburban, and urban), number of drivers and rides, and total fares based on drivers, rides, and types of cities; in order to improve access to services and determine affordability for unaccessed areas. 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Based on the multiple-line chart, "Total Fare by City Type," total fares ranged between $1600-$2500 per week in urban areas, compared to $200-$500 per week in rural areas. Total fares in the suburban areas ranged between $750-1450 per week. Total urban fares were 63%, suburban fares were 31%, and rural fares were 7%.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide a business recommendation to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based on the "Ride Fare Data(2019)" chart below, the average fare in rural areas is about $38, average fare in suburban areas is $30, and in urban areas, the fare is about $25. The fares in suburban and rural areas are more expensive than in the urban areas; however, there are less drivers in those areas. A potential business recommendation is to increase the number drivers in rural and suburban areas, while maintaining the current drivers in urban areas.
